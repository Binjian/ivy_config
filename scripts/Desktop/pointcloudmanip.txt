Converting to PLY
To open the point cloud in other applications, such as Blender and Meshlab, you will have to convert the generated PCD to PLY or another supported format.

To do this run the following command:

pcl_pcd2ply <input.pcd> <output.ply>
To process multiple files use the following with zsh:

for i in *.pcd ; do pcl_pcd2ply $i ${i:r}.ply ; done
The generated file uses meters as it's units. This works well in Blender but may need to be scaled in other applications.
